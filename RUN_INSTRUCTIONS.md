# Start Script Instruction

Because you have just installed `Node.js` and `Go`, your current command prompt session does not have them loaded into the environment variables.

To fix this immediately without having to reboot your entire computer or IDE, I have created a script called `start.bat` for you.

## How to use:
In your terminal, just run:
```cmd
.\start.bat
```

This script will temporarily load the required programs into your path, and then ask you if you want to start the Go backend, the React frontend, or both at the same time.
